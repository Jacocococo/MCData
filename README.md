This is the branch for v2.0 beta

v2.0 will implement [JD Gui](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui) into MCData and automatically load jars

Like the alpha, this version uses a few libraries that the previous version didn't. These libraries needs to be added to the project as jars

- [antlr-4.5](https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.5-complete.jar)
- [rsyntaxtextarea-3.0.4](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/com.fifesoft/rsyntaxtextarea/3.0.4/source-code)
- [JD-Core-1.1.3](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-core/releases/download/v1.1.3/jd-core-1.1.3.jar)
